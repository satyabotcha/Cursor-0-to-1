# Status Report: Company Logo Upload Feature

## Feature Overview

We've implemented a new feature allowing companies to upload their logo during the registration process. This enhances the personalization of their account and provides a more professional appearance in the API key display.

## Implementation Details

1. Updated `CompanyForm` component to include file upload for company logo
2. Added logo preview functionality in the form
3. Modified `ApiKeyDisplay` component to show the uploaded logo
4. Updated `Voice` component to handle the new logo data

## Security Considerations

- File upload is limited to image files only
- Frontend validation for file type and size should be implemented
- Backend validation and secure storage of uploaded files must be implemented (not covered in this update)

## Next Steps

1. Implement backend API for secure file upload and storage
2. Add file type and size validation on the frontend
3. Optimize image loading and display for better performance
4. Consider adding image cropping/resizing functionality for consistency

## Polish Enhancements

- Smooth animations for logo preview using Framer Motion
- Responsive design for logo display in both form and API key view
- Error handling for failed uploads or invalid file types

This feature adds a "wow" factor for enterprise customers by allowing them to see their brand represented immediately after registration.
