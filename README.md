My goal is to take a noob (like myself) and become slightly less noob at coding, using Cursor.

Note: [text](https://www.jointakeoff.com/courses) -> for a deeper, visual guide, I would recommend learning from this course.  


WTF is Cursor?
Cursor is an AI Code Editor. 

It's a fork of VS code. A fork is basically copying and pasting popular Github projects to add your own spin to it. 

Forking is like taking your grandmaâ€™s pancake recipe and swapping out the syrup for jet fuel. Same batter, but now your breakfast could launch a rocket.

So using Cursor is like using VS code, but with AI superpowers. 

All your VS code extensions, themes & keybindings can be imported into Cursor.


    IDE?
