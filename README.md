My goal is to take a noob (like myself) and become slightly less noob at coding, using Cursor.

Note: [text](https://www.jointakeoff.com/courses) -> for a deeper, visual guide, I would recommend learning from this course.  


##WTF is Cursor?
Cursor is an AI Code Editor. 

It's a fork of VS code. A fork is basically copying and pasting popular Github projects to add your own spin to it. 

Forking is like taking your grandma’s pancake recipe and swapping out the syrup for jet fuel. Same batter, but now your breakfast could launch a rocket.

So using Cursor is like using VS code, but with AI superpowers. 

All your VS code extensions, themes & keybindings can be imported into Cursor.

## Boring Bits - Installation, Setup & Recommendations

### Installation

Head to https://www.cursor.com/pricing and sign up for a free account. You get two-weeks of "Pro" for free, which we will exploit to the max.

Download and install Cursor from the website.

Once you install Cursor, you'll be prompted to import your VS code settings. It's a good idea to say yes & import all your settings.

### Setup

Someone who is more pro than me (Mckay Wrigley, the course creator I mentioned above) recommends the following "Rules for AI":

Head to Cursor Settings:

1. "Rules for AI" and add the following:

DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH LEVEL STUFF, IF I ASK FOR FIX OR EXPLANATION, I WANT ACTUAL CODE OR EXPLANATION!!! I DON'T WANT "Here's how you can blablabla"

- Be casual unless otherwise specified
- Be terse
- Suggest solutions that I didn’t think about—anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert
- Be accurate and thorough
- Give the answer immediately. Provide detailed explanations and restate my query in your own words if necessary after giving the answer
- Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom
- You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me
- No moral lectures
- Discuss safety only when it's crucial and non-obvious
- If your content policy is an issue, provide the closest acceptable response and explain the content policy issue afterward
- Cite sources whenever possible at the end, not inline
- No need to mention your knowledge cutoff
- No need to disclose you're an AI
- Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code.
- Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question. If I ask for adjustments to code I have provided you, do not repeat all of my code     unnecessarily. Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you make. Multiple code blocks are ok.

2. Features:
- Enable "Partial accepts"
- Enable "Auto parse inline edit links"
