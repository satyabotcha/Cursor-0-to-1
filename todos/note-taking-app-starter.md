# Note Taking App Starter Instructions

## Overview

Here's a basic list of todos for a note-taking app that we could implement in `page.tsx`:

1. Set up the basic React component structure ✅
2. Create a state to store notes (array of objects) ✅
3. Implement a form to add new notes ✅
4. Display the list of notes ✅
5. Add functionality to delete notes ✅
6. Implement note editing feature ✅
7. Add search functionality to filter notes ✅
8. Implement markdown parsing for note content ✅
9. Add tags or categories for notes (partially implemented, not used in UI yet)
10. Implement local storage to persist notes ✅
11. Add a dark mode toggle ✅
12. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+N to focus on new note input) ✅
13. Add a rich text editor option ✅
14. Implement note sharing functionality (not implemented)
15. Add sorting options for the note list (not implemented)

## Implementation Summary

We've created a functional note-taking app with the following features:

- Basic React component structure using hooks (useState, useEffect)
- State management for notes, with each note having an id, content, tags, and isRichText flag
- Form to add new notes with option to use rich text editor
- Display of notes list with markdown rendering for plain text and HTML rendering for rich text
- Delete functionality for notes
- In-place editing of notes (plain text and rich text)
- Search functionality to filter notes
- Markdown parsing using ReactMarkdown for plain text notes
- Rich text editing using react-quill
- Local storage to persist notes between sessions
- Dark mode toggle
- Basic keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+N to focus on new note input)

The app uses TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling. Some features like note sharing and sorting options were not implemented in this version but can be added in future iterations.

To further improve the app, consider:

- Implementing the remaining features (sorting, sharing)
- Enhancing the tag system and adding a UI for it
- Improving the styling and layout
- Adding more keyboard shortcuts
- Implementing a more robust state management solution if the app grows in complexity
- Enhancing the rich text editor functionality (e.g., custom toolbar options)
- Adding the ability to switch between rich text and plain text for existing notes
